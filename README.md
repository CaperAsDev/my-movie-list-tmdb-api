# my-movie-list-tmdb-api
 This is my project done with the Api rest course of platzi in 2023
- This is the website of the Api used for this project: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started

##Learning: 
I get to apply so many concepts that i've been learning for the past year.

1. Learn to use axios to simplify the fetch of data.
2. I Use a lot of DOM manipulation, to create nodes and to get them o to build components.
3. With the use of some properties of the nodes, i built a simple function to show the progress of a container's scroll, which for me seems to be quite complicated before trying myself.
4. Lots of styles applied, i'm not the best UI or UX designer ever, but i did my best to present an appealing web interface.
5. I wasn't used to build applications that big, so it was the first time i use modules to connect so many files, now i feel more comfortable using modules.
6. I applied many other concepts like, currying, scope, closure, localStorage, events, just to name some.
7. And one of the most important achivements for me was to have the confidence to propose things, features, styles and features that the teacher did't concider and start building things from my own knowledge and ideas. I lost the fear to "touch" the code that aldeady works to make it better or to reorganize the code in different files. This with not doubt is my first personal proyect, built mostly with my code and knowledge.

Im so proud of it, but i know i will improve a lot more from now and in no time i will be doing stuff much better.
